## Projet 2 : Argumentation-based dialogue for choosing a sport
### Overview
The goal is to simulate an argumentation-based dialogue between artificial agents which will interact to make a joint decision regarding choosing the best sport. One can then imagine several applications. For instance by studying the most impactful arguments.

### Agent Preferences
#### Data about sports
We prepare a data.json file beforehand. An object in this file represents an agent (the implementation is meant for 2 so far). It is represented by an integer and comes with a "Criteria_List" property which gives the ordered criteria importance for the agent. Then there is a property for each of the sports to compare. Each property contains a a list of key-value pairs, one for each criteria. Here are the criteria we chose:
* a
* b
* c

### Communication


### Arguments

### Selecting arguments

### Relations among arguments
